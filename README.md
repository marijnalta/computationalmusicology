**What is your corpus, why did you choose it, and what do you think is interesting about it?**

My corpus is a playlist of my own, containing almost 300 techno tracks. I chose this corpus because A) I like techno and cannot wait to go out again and B) I want to learn more about the specific subgenres. The diversity between the subgenres makes this playlist interesting to analyse. I want to find out if I can detect the different subgenres with

If you have been chosen to peer review this assignment (and are a techno snob), please do not hesitate to send me your own playlists.

**What are the natural groups or comparison points in your corpus (e.g., albums, artists, genres, people)? What do you expect to be different among these groups, what do you expect to be the same, and what are you unsure about?**
Genre, BPM


**How representative are the tracks in your corpus for the groups you want to compare? For example, is there a well-known difference between the live and studio versions of one of the artists, or is Spotify missing an important recording? Or if you are using a personal playlist of yourself or someone else, what percentage of your or their music listening takes place on Spotify? If your corpus is genre-based, how well do you think it covers the genre you are interested in, and what do you think are the most important gaps? There is no such thing as a perfect corpus, and it is important to think from the beginning about its strengths and limitations.
My corpus is quite representative for the whole techno genre. I am not too deep into the scene, so I am pretty sure the tracks in the playlist are the more popular ones.**

**Identify several tracks in your corpus that are either extremely typical or atypical. Why do you think that they are so typical or so strange? Several pages of your final portfolio will be dedicated to detailed analyses of specific tracks, and so it is important to think about which ones might be most interesting.**
